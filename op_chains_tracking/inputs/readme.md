**Updates Spec**:
- Re-configure as a yml, or some format that's easier to edit and handle for "flexibility" (i.e. unique attributes & config changes)
- Core unit is ecosystem, versus chain (i.e. Base Ecosystem, Zora Ecosystem)
- Allow for multiple chains within one ecosystem (i.e. multiple mainnets, multiple testnets)
